### Intro
In my [last post](https://medium.com/@walterdeane/setting-up-a-local-llm-for-code-assistance), I walked through setting up a local LLM for code assistance. Once I had it running, the next obvious question was:  

**How practical is it, really, on my hardware?**  

It’s one thing to run a model. It’s another to know if it responds quickly enough for coding, writing, or other tasks. If it is too slow im not really going to use it for day to day programming. The setup is still helpful for when im learning to use ai itself like setting up a local vector database and using RAG or prototyping an MCP, but it wouldn't be something I would suffer through. I hat staring at builds so i'm not going to want to suffer through that everytime I want a an autocomplete. To find out if this would work for me and what LLM works best, I wrote a small Bash script that benchmarks Ollama models. 

I’ve put both the script and my benchmark data in a GitHub repo so you can run the tests yourself:

The data isn't completed I'm still playing with models but I hoped it could be useful to someone else. The sample output and csv are more for demostration sake. You can download the script tweak it to whatever LLMs you want and give it a go.

### Why Benchmark?
- Different models (Mistral, Codestral, Llama 2, DeepSeek, Qwen) perform very differently.  
- Quantization (q4 vs q5, etc.) changes both memory footprint and speed.  
- Benchmarks make the trade-offs visible: sometimes a smaller, “weaker” model is more usable because it streams tokens faster.

### The Script
Here’s the script I use. It times execution, saves output, and logs results to a CSV file. I did a bit of poking around on what were good LLMs for a local machine. and I wanted to test a few things. The LLMs I chose have variations in parameters, quantization, whether they were instruct versions, and some are MoE models.  I don't really break them down in this blog. I might do another blog on what all of that means. This blog is just for sharing the script so that you can get started comparing on your own system.

📂 [Script on GitHub](https://github.com/walterdeane/blog-drafts/blob/main/blogs/002_local_benchmarking_setup_for_llms/benchmark-llms.sh)



### Script Features
This isn’t just a barebones timer — the script has a few features that make it hopefully more useful for real benchmarking:

- **Built-in model list (customizable):** You can run it against common local models out-of-the-box, or pass your own model names on the command line.  
- **Auto-downloads models if missing:** If Ollama doesn’t find a model locally, it will pull it for you the first time you run it. That way, you don’t need to pre-install every model you want to test. It also warms up the model with a simple call before benchmarking so the output is closer to how it will work when you are using it. 
- **CSV logging:** Each run writes a row into `benchmark-results.csv`, including model name, duration, status, and the path to the raw output. Perfect for comparing runs later or importing into a spreadsheet.  
- **Saved outputs:** Each model’s raw response is written to a text file. This lets you evaluate not just *how fast* a model runs, but also *what kind of output* it produces.  I might add a code quality checker in in a later version.
- **Flexible prompts:** The script uses a default coding-related prompt, but you can easily swap it out with something closer to your real workload (translation, summarization, Q&A, etc.).  

Together, these features let you evaluate not only raw speed but also whether a model feels “good enough” for your actual use case on your hardware.

### Running the Benchmark
Make the script executable and run it against one or more models:

```bash
chmod +x benchmark-llms.sh
./benchmark-llms.sh mistral:7b-instruct codellama:13b qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q5_K_M
```

This will log results to the terminal and append them to `benchmark-results.csv`. There are several options in the script. You could just call it without a list and it will prompt you instead. LLMs get updated and superceded very quickly so you will probably want to edit the list in the script anyway.

---

### Example Results
Here’s one run from my machine. **Don’t expect your numbers to match mine** — results vary widely depending on CPU/GPU, RAM, and which models/quantizations you load. The whole point of this script is to have a way to test on your local system how well it works for you. A lot of AI blogs are engagement bait with wild claims either way about how evil or good AI is. Hopefully, by running this locally you will have a way to make your own opinion.

### Takeaways
- **Speed matters as much as smarts.** A smaller model that streams quickly often feels better to use.  
- **Quantization is key.** Switching between q4 and q5 changes usability and memory footprint.  
- **Measure, don’t guess.** Your hardware will give very different results than mine.  

---

### Extending the Script
- Add multiple prompts and average results.  
- Compare different quantization levels directly.  
- Append results from multiple runs into a master CSV to track changes over time.  

---

### Final Thoughts
Running LLMs locally still feels like the 90s — closing apps, watching memory, hoping nothing crashes. But with a small Bash script, you can **measure instead of guess**.  

The numbers I’ve shared are just an example. The whole point is to run the script yourself and see what works best on *your* system. That’s the only benchmark that really matters.
